  - Bridge Relay
    - not listed in the public Tor directory
    - use pluggable transports to obfuscate their traffic to make it harder to detect
  - Guard Relay
    - first relay (hop) in a Tor circuit
    - stable and fast
  - Middle Relay
    - concealment
  - Exit Relay
    - Exit Policy
- Onion Hidden Service (.onion)
